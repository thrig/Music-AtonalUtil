 * 1.15 - Audit against Rahn book tables + tests for such. Forte numbers
   use Z instead of z to conform with said book (though [Zz] still
   accepted in input). Better document half_prime_form vs. other *_form
   methods.
 * 1.14 added adjacent_interval_content().
 * 1.12 mandatory POD tests, refaddr on nexti and cohorts in unlikely
   event some object-but-array thingy is used. Makefile.PL
   maukeification.
 * 1.10 added mininterval().
 * gen_melody, check_melody created in 1.03, might see future
   changes in API.

Otherwise, see the git repository.
